# p1-ui-assist
Some UI code to guide you while writing the front end of P1
 - The UI portion can be found inside [/ui/](./ui/)
 - The API can be found inside [/src/main/java/com/revature/](src/main/java/revagenda/)

The API is very bare bones. There is no persistence, it just stores objects in a HashMap for as long as the backend is running. There is much more inline documentation. See the comments throughout the .html, .js, and .css files in the UI section.
